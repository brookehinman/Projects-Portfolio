2. Plot the position and size of hurricanes Katrina (2005), Sandy (2012), Harvey (2017), and Ian (2022) when they made landfall. If there are multiple landfalls, pick the strongest landfall that occurred in the US. Include the storm tracks in your plot if you can. You can put this all on one plot if itâ€™s not too messy.

```{r setup}
library(hurricaneHelper)
data(hurdat)

# Katrina 2005
plotstorms("AL122005", hurdat)
stormsize(44703, hurdat)

# Sandy 2012
plotstorms("AL182012", hurdat)
stormsize(48707, hurdat)

# Harvey 2017
plotstorms("AL092017", hurdat)
stormsize(50477, hurdat)

# Ian 2022
plotstorms("AL092022", hurdat)
stormsize(53816, hurdat)
```
